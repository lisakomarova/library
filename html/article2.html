						<p>These works can really change your view of the world and the place of a person in it.</p>
						<h5>✨ "100 Years of Solitude" by Gabriel Garcia Marquez</h5>
						<p>
							The novel is a myth, an epic novel, a parable about the development of humanity, where everyone is doomed to loneliness, and only it dominates the world, where everything is entangled in the bonds of fatal love.
						</p>
						<p>Perhaps we ourselves do not want to face the truth, how monstrously alone each of us. Everyone has his own way and loneliness too, his own, so different, so different, always exhausting and devastating with cold.</p>

						<h5>✨ «Cat's Cradle» Kurt Vonnegut</h5>
						<p>
							The book is bright, interesting, sometimes makes you smile, but more often - to think. And there is a minus. Too many truths and too little time to think: a kaleidoscope of events makes you stop and ask yourself: “What did I just read?”
						</p>
						<p>It is worth waiting five years and re-reading the book a second time to become aware of it, see the missing details and put together a more or less complete picture.</p>
						<h5>✨ “Farewell, Weapon!” By Ernest Hemingway </h5>
						<p>
							The first - and the best! - The book "lost generation" of English-language literature about the First World War. The book is about the war in which naive boys became “cannon fodder” - and they either died or were hardened to the limit. About the war, where love is just a brief moment of peace, having neither the past nor the future. On the war - about which you want to forget, but you can not remember!
						</p>
						<h5>✨Fight Club by Chuck Palahniuk</h5>
						<p>
							This is a book about freedom, about finding your own "I." We all live in the captivity of things, public opinion, almost all have identical desires, plans. But we want to show that all of them are such individuals. "Because you put a feather in your ass," says Tyler, "you have not yet become a peacock." It is necessary to break out of everyday life, dreary affairs, to understand what you really want. The main thing - do not forget that this should be your road, and not some kind of left Tyler.

						<h5>✨ The Lord of the Flies by William Golding</h5>
						<p>
							Uninhabited island. Boundless uncross-cutting Ocean. Boys without adult supervision. A split society on the example of a small children's community. Revolution. Bloodshed. Death.
						</p>
						<p>
							The book was published in 1954, now it is the 2018th, but nothing has changed, if such a situation with the island in the ocean and children happens again - everything will be exactly the same. A very scary book to read.
						</p>
						<h5>✨ "Chapaev and Emptiness" by Viktor Pelevin </h5>
						<p>
							This is the first work in the world literature, whose action takes place in absolute emptiness. In fact, it takes place in 1919 in the division of Chapaev, in which the main character, the decadent poet Peter Void, serves as a commissar, and also in our days, and, as often happens with Pelevin, in the virtual space ...
						</p>
						<h5>✨ "451 degrees Fahrenheit" by Ray Bradbury</h5>
						<p>
							Book-cry, ruthless accusation of the entire consumer civilization. The book, which should be on the table for every person of the XXI century, when we are very close to the world described in the pages of the novel. In essence, there is no novel, there is one continuous, continuous cry of despair of a person who has awakened from universal blindness and terrified of what is happening ... cry for help when the hero does not know what to do and where to go.
						</p>

						<h5>✨ “Kill a Mockingbird” by Harper Lee </h5>
						<p>
							The book is about growing up a little girl who goes through adventures, fun, relationships with peers. The restless little girl has a lot to learn, including the unfairness of life: in relation to children, in relation to the weak, in relation to people with different skin color. As a result, we see that kindness, sympathy and mutual assistance depend not on skin color or social position, or public opinion. It depends on the soul of man.
						</p>
						<h5>✨ "Martin Eden" by Jack London</h5>
						<p>
							A young sailor, Martin Eden, accidentally saves a young bourgeois rake in a street fight. In gratitude, he invites him to his house, where he introduces him to his family. Martin is crazy about falling in love with the sister of a young man, Ruth, a girl educated, not poor - the exact opposite of Martin himself. To win the girl's heart, Martin begins to work hard on himself - he studies the teachings of philosophers, teaches grammar, mathematics, and begins to read a lot. And gradually understanding that the accumulated knowledge requires implementation, he begins to write himself.
						</p>
						<h5>✨ "The teachings of Don Juan" Carlos Castaneda</h5>
						<p>
							According to the deep conviction of the teacher of Carlos Castaneda don Juan Matus, the magician and the warrior, people who lived in the New World ten thousand years ago, deeply studied the Universe and the problems of perception. A modern person cannot even partially imagine their true power. The author reveals the secrets of the shamans of ancient Mexico in the pages of this book.
