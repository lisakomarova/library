						<p>Creativity is very important for personal development. Only lazy does not write about this, but what if the muse does not come, there is no inspiration, and there are no ideas? New book review How to Green is dedicated to all creative people and those who want to develop their creative vein. With the books listed in the review, you will be more consciously aware of your work and you will not lack creative ideas.</p>
						<h5>1. “I want more ideas” - Steve Rowling</h5>

							Why read: The book contains over a hundred techniques and exercises for the development of creative thinking. The book “I want more ideas” can be viewed as a two-in-one guide: quick solutions and detailed explanations.
						</p>
						<p>
							What this book is about in two words: According to Steve Rowling, to create more creative ideas, you need to use divergent thinking. Divergent thinking is a search for solutions beyond the obvious. For example, instead of looking for one correct solution, you offer a huge number of options. Emma Coates, an artist of Pixar, gives this advice: “Drop the first idea that you had. And also the second, third, fourth, fifth - drop all the obvious. Surprise yourself. ” The book “I want more ideas” will stimulate your creative spirit. And if, on the contrary, you have a fountain of ideas, it will help to take them under control.
						</p>
						<h5> 2. "In Search of Ideas" - Grant Snyder </h5>

						</p>
						<p> Why read: “Looking for ideas” is an illustrated study of creativity. We are intrigued! </p>
						<p>
							What this book is about in two words: It shows the process of creativity from different sides: it is multitasking, and improvisation, and the workflow, and the inner world, and the study of oneself. After reading the comics on the creative theme (there are plenty of them in the book), you will definitely get inspired and go to create. If you want to know how ideas look, where they come from, whether you can touch them and even how to catch the thought by the tail, then you will like the book. Great motivator! The author himself says that the book will be especially useful for those who are faced with procrastination or a blank sheet.
