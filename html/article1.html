						<p>If you learn English, the surest way to replenish vocabulary and consolidate knowledge is to read books in the original. Today, Natalia Zhelyaskova shares with us five favorite works that will not only help you in learning a language, but will also give you real pleasure from reading.</p>
						<p>In today's compilation, I want to share my most favorite works in English, which will help you to expand your vocabulary, enrich it with more than one dozen magnificent sound expressions and just give you incredible pleasure while reading. On my list you will find books for different levels of training, but all without exception are written in a completely magnificent language. These are the very publications that you want to keep in your home library, make notes in the margins with a pencil in order to reread the most favorite places (by the way, I wrote out such notes for you after describing each work), and you should have a notepad or open notes of a mobile phone to put the most winning expressions and phrases there.</p>

						<h5>✨«Winnie-the-Pooh» Alan Alexander Milne✨ </h5>
						<p>
							Perhaps almost everyone is familiar with the adventures of the clumsy teddy bear. But you will be surprised how charming the story seems to be already known to us in the original language! The magic begins literally from the very first pages. In addition, you will surely draw from the book new interesting details of famous stories that you might have missed as a child. For example, for me the real revelation was the origin of the name Pooh. I'm sure after reading you, like me, want to buy another copy with colorful stylish illustrations for your personal collection, and Eeyore and Piglet will be as close and loved as the good old Eeyore and Piglet.

						<h5>✨«The prince and the pauper» Mark Twain ✨</h5>
						<p>
							Another story that has been known to many since childhood, which in an absolutely beautifully beautiful language will tell about the adventures of two boys, like two drops of water. In addition to the really interesting story, the book contains many beautiful details from the life of the royal court, descriptions of the attributes of luxury and in contrast - a story about the life of the street Offal Court. If you put it all together, you get a wonderful piece with a bunch of various useful words and expressions for all occasions.
						</p>
						<h5>✨«The picture of Dorian Gray» Oscar Wilde ✨</h5>
						<p>
							“The Portrait of Dorian Gray” is, among other things, an unimaginably beautiful ode to youth, beauty and, of course, love. This work is really a real fount of quotes about the big and eternal. No other book in English in my home library, I must admit, does not have such an abundance of marks and underscores on its pages. I'm sure from the first chapters you will understand what I mean. Oscar Wilde's immortal creation wants to be read slowly, leaving time to think over the words that have fallen deeply into the soul and not indulging in the pleasure of reciting the most beautiful language passages. So I advise you to settle down more comfortably and make sure that nothing distracts you from reading.

						<h5>✨Short stories by Agatha Christie ✨</h5>
						<p>
							Agatha Christie, being one of the most famous female authors in the history of literature, definitely does not need to be introduced. In fact, to read the original, you can choose any work of the writer - an inimitable style (which is worth only one Hercule Poirot!), The most subtle humor and immense pleasure are guaranteed. But I recommend to start all the same to opt for a collection of stories (of which, by the way, Christie has as many as 150 pieces). The abundance of plots, characters and locations will provide you with the maximum number of new useful words, and a small amount of works will make it easier to cope with reading if you learn the language not so long ago. I am sure that you will have especially favorite stories, to which then more than once it will be pleasant to return. My favorites are “A fruitful Sunday” and “Wasps’ nest ”!
						</p>
						<h5>✨«The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes» Arthur Conan Doyle ✨</h5>
						<p>
							Even if you are already familiar with the adventures of a well-known detective and his good friend in all possible interpretations existing today, the work in the original language will surely not leave you indifferent. And having finished the printed version, you can take on the episode with the same name with Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead role. If you have already watched it, it will even play into your hands - it will be easier to understand the dialogues and catch the common sense of the heroes' replicas. In addition, on the Internet it is easy enough to find educational materials based on the above-mentioned series. For example, SkyEng has a completely free course, which can be received weekly by mail, which is very convenient for consolidating material and analyzing the main points of the watched series.
